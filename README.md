    return (score,);
}
```

Add a function to record game result : 
```cairo 
@external
func recordResult{syscall_ptr: felt*, pedersen_ptr: HashBuiltin*, range_check_ptr}(
    playerA_Address: felt, playerB_Address: felt, winner_Address: felt
) -> () {
    ELO.recordResult(playerA_Address, playerB_Address, winner_Address);
    return ();
